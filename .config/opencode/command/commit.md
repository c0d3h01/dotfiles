description: Generate grouped or single Conventional Commits message using commit rules
---

Write commit messages terse and exact. Conventional Commits format. No fluff. Why over what.

## Rules

**Subject line:**

- `<type>(<scope>): <imperative summary>` — `<scope>` optional
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `build`, `ci`, `style`, `revert`
- Imperative mood: "add", "fix", "remove" — not "added", "adds", "adding"
- ≤50 chars when possible, hard cap 72
- No trailing period
- Match project convention for capitalization after the colon

**Body (only if needed):**

- Skip entirely when subject is self-explanatory
- Add body only for: non-obvious _why_, breaking changes, migration notes, linked issues
- Wrap at 72 chars
- Bullets `-` not `*`
- Reference issues/PRs at end: `Closes #42`, `Refs #17`

**What NEVER goes in:**

- "This commit does X", "I", "we", "now", "currently" — the diff says what
- "As requested by..." — use Co-authored-by trailer
- "Generated with Claude Code" or any AI attribution — unless the user's own rule requires an `Assisted-by`/AI-attribution trailer, then add it as a trailer
- Emoji (unless project convention requires)
- Restating the file name when scope already says it

## Auto-Clarity

Always include body for: breaking changes, security fixes, data migrations, anything reverting a prior commit. Never compress these into subject-only — future debuggers need the context.

## Boundaries

Only generates the commit message. Does not run `git commit`, does not stage files, does not amend. Output the message as a code block ready to paste. "stop commit" or "normal mode": revert to verbose commit style.

Diff source: `$ARGUMENTS` if provided, else `git diff --staged`, fallback to `git diff` when staged is empty.

Partition diff into groups by logical concern: files serving same fix/feat/refactor purpose → one group. Unrelated concerns → separate groups. Single concern → single group, single message.

Per group output one message following the rules above exactly, each as its own code block ready to paste, ordered independent-first. Prefix each block with the group's paths as `git add` line.

Do not stage, commit, or amend. Never squash distinct concerns into one message to save output.
